  “I have followed Dave Stryker's playing since his early days in Omaha through
  his long stay with Stanley Turrentine and his longstanding relationship with
  the great alto player Steve Slagle (another undersung heavy out there) and he
  just gets better and better with one of the most joyous feels around.”<br />–Pat

<h4>Journeyman</h4>
<p>
  Dave Stryker grew up in Omaha, Nebraska and moved to New York City in 1980.
  After establishing himself in the local music scene, he joined organist Jack
  McDuff's group for two years 1984-85. When McDuff wasn't on the road
  (literally traveling by van all over the country) they worked a steady
  four-night a week gig at Dude's Lounge in Harlem. His first break, this turned
  out to be an invaluable experience, paying his dues night after night with the
  soulful jazz organist.
</p>
<p>
  It was at Dude's Lounge that Stryker met tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine,
  who would occasionally sit in. After leaving McDuff, Turrentine asked Stryker
  to join his quintet. From 1986-1995 he played with the legendary saxophonist
  at all the major festivals, concert halls, and clubs throughout the world. He
  is featured on two Turrentine CD's (Stanley recorded Stryker's tune
  “Sidesteppin”). With Turrentine, Stryker was able to play with such jazz
  greats as Dizzy Gillespie and Freddie Hubbard. The ten years playing alongside
  the tenor legend helped Stryker realize the importance of having his own
  sound. Dave continued to work with Stanley and was with him during his final
  week at the Blue Note in NYC, when he passed in Sept. 2000.
</p>
<h4>Composer and publisher</h4>
<p>
  Early on Stryker realized that as much as he loved playing standards and the
  jazz repertoire he had to have something of his own to give to the music. He
  feels that his writing combined with his playing is what shapes his musical
  expression. He has recorded and published over 150 of his own compositions and
  has released “The Dave Stryker Songbook” with most of his original music. Also
  18 of the compositions (from the first five SteepleChase CD's) are compiled in
  the book: “The Music of Dave Stryker” (SteepleChase Music) which can be
  ordered on this website.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the other artists who have recorded Dave's music are: Stanley
  Turrentine, Kevin Mahogany, Victor Lewis, and Steve Slagle. Dave continues to
  perform with The Dave Stryker Organ Trio, Dave Stryker Eight Track Band, and
  his Blue to the Bone Band. Dave Stryker's Trio opened for Steely Dan's 2022
  Summer tour “Earth After Hours”.

<h4>Recent gigs</h4>

  Recent gigs have included Birdland, the Blue Note, Dizzy's Club Coca Cola at
  Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Monterey Jazz Festival, The Newport Jazz Festival,
  The Keystone Korner in Baltimore MD, The Jazz Bakery in LA, and tours of
  Europe, Canada and Japan.

<p>
  Dave co-led The Stryker/Slagle Band for 30 years with saxophonist Steve
  Slagle. He has appeared on over 75 CD's as a sideman. Past sideman work has
  included vocalist Kevin Mahogany's group, with Dave writing and arranging
  music for Kevin's Telarc release “Pride and Joy” and “Another Time, Another
  Place” on Warner Bros and tours of Europe, Japan, Brazil, Poland and Carnegie
  Hall.
</p>
<h4>Producer</h4>

  which is the only existing record of the brilliant jazz playing of the late
  underground legend who was his friend, former teacher and member of the
  Crusaders. Dave has also produced “A Tribute to Grant Green” on Evidence Music
